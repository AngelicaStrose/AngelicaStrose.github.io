    <h1> ABOUT ME</h1>

  <P>

    Hi there! My name is Angelica St. Rose and I’m a 21-year-old graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. My interests involve: machine learning (particularly to predict stock market trends),  data analytics, user experience design, and salsa dancing. I’m currently on a mission to add more personal projects to my repertoire, so check out my github from time to time. My first one? This website! It was developed using AngularJS, Typescript, Javascript, and webpack. As I learn more, I’ll improve it piece by piece. See you back here soon!
